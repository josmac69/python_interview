# Data type hints - in Python 3.5+

ChatSonic:

Python 3.5 introduced a feature called Type Hints, which allows developers to provide hints about the expected types of function arguments, class attributes, and return values.

Here's an example of how to use Type Hints to declare the type of a variable:

```python
def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    return length * width

result = calculate_area(10, 20)
```

In the above code, we have declared the expected types of the `length` and `width` arguments as `float` using the colon notation. We have also declared the expected return type of the `calculate_area` function as `float` using the arrow notation.

If we pass any other data type than `float` to the `calculate_area` function, Python will raise a `TypeError` indicating that the argument has the wrong type. This helps ensure that only the expected data types are used in the code, making it more robust and easier to maintain.

Yes, you can use type hints in Python to declare the type of a variable and ensure that only values of that type can be assigned to it. Type hints were introduced in Python 3.5 and are used to specify the type of variables, function arguments, and return values.

Here's an example of how to use type hints to declare the type of a variable:

```
# Declaring a variable with type hint
name: str = "John Doe"

# Trying to assign a value of a different type to the variable
name = 10  # This will raise a type error

```

In this example, we have declared the variable name with the type hint str, which means that only string values can be assigned to it. If we try to assign a value of a different type, such as an integer, to the variable, Python will raise a type error.

Note that type hints in Python are not enforced at runtime, so they do not affect the behavior of the code. They are simply a way to provide information to other developers and tools, such as code editors and linters, to help catch potential errors and improve code readability.
