Unpacking syntax in Python refers to the process of extracting individual elements from an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) and assigning them to multiple variables. It's a convenient way to extract values from iterables without having to access them using indices or loops. Unpacking syntax can be applied to any iterable that has a fixed and known number of elements.

Here's a simple example of unpacking syntax in Python:
```
# Suppose you have a tuple with three elements
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# You can use unpacking syntax to assign each element to a separate variable
a, b, c = my_tuple

print(a)  # Output: 1
print(b)  # Output: 2
print(c)  # Output: 3
```
Unpacking syntax can also be used with lists, sets, and other iterables:

```
# Unpacking a list
my_list = [4, 5, 6]
x, y, z = my_list

print(x)  # Output: 4
print(y)  # Output: 5
print(z)  # Output: 6
```
Python 3.0 introduced "extended unpacking" using the star operator (*). This allows you to unpack elements from iterables with an arbitrary number of elements:

```
# Using extended unpacking with a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
a, *b, c = my_list

print(a)  # Output: 1
print(b)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]
print(c)  # Output: 6
```
In this example, the variable a gets assigned the first element, c gets assigned the last element, and b gets assigned a list containing the remaining elements.

Keep in mind that unpacking requires the number of variables on the left side to match the number of elements in the iterable, or else a ValueError will be raised. However, if you use the extended unpacking syntax with the star operator, it can accommodate varying numbers of elements.
