Here are some of the main subversions of Python 3 and the main new features they bring:

1. Python 3.0: Released in 2008, Python 3.0 was a major update that introduced several breaking changes from Python 2.x, including changes to the print statement syntax, the division operator, and the string representation. It also introduced new features such as the `nonlocal` keyword and the `bytes` data type.
2. Python 3.1: Released in 2009, Python 3.1 included bug fixes and minor improvements over Python 3.0, but did not introduce any major new features.
3. Python 3.2: Released in 2011, Python 3.2 introduced several new features and improvements, including a new `os.scandir()` function for directory scanning, the `functools.lru_cache()` decorator for caching function results, and a new `unittest.mock` library for testing.
4. Python 3.3: Released in 2012, Python 3.3 included several new features and improvements, such as a new `yield from` expression for generators, a new `u''` prefix for Unicode strings, and support for the `pip` package manager.
5. Python 3.4: Released in 2014, Python 3.4 introduced several new features and improvements, including a new `asyncio` library for asynchronous programming, the `pathlib` module for working with file paths, and a new `enum` module for enumerations.
6. Python 3.5: Released in 2015, Python 3.5 introduced several new features and improvements, such as the `typing` module for type hints, the `async` and `await` keywords for asynchronous programming, and support for matrix multiplication with the `@` operator.
7. Python 3.6: Released in 2016, Python 3.6 introduced several new features and improvements, such as formatted string literals (also known as f-strings), the `random.choices()` function for weighted random choices, and a new `secrets` module for generating cryptographically secure random numbers.
8. Python 3.7: Released in 2018, Python 3.7 introduced several new features and improvements, such as data classes for creating classes with less boilerplate code, postponed evaluation of type annotations for improved performance, and the `asyncio.run()` function for running asyncio code in the main thread.
9. Python 3.8: Released in 2019, Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements, such as the walrus operator (`:=`) for assignment expressions, positional-only parameters in functions, and the `functools.cache()` decorator for caching function results.
10. Python 3.9: Released in 2020, Python 3.9 introduced several new features and improvements, such as improved performance for dictionaries, new syntax for merging dictionaries (`|` operator), and support for using decorators with classes and functions.
11. Python 3.10: Released in 2021, Python 3.10 introduced several new features and improvements, such as structural pattern matching, improved error messages for type hints, and improved performance for startup time and import time.

Overall, each subversion of Python 3 has introduced new features and improvements to the language, making it more powerful, efficient, and easier to use for developers.
