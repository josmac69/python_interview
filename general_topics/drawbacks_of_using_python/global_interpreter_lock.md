Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism that is used in the CPython implementation of Python, which is the most commonly used version of the language. The GIL is a mechanism that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core systems.

In other words, the GIL ensures that only one thread can execute Python code at a time within a single interpreter process. This means that even if a Python program is running on a multi-core CPU, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time, while other threads must wait for the GIL to be released before they can execute their own code.

The purpose of the GIL is to simplify the implementation of the Python interpreter and reduce the risk of concurrency-related issues, such as race conditions or deadlocks. However, it can also limit the performance of multithreaded Python programs that need to execute many CPU-bound tasks simultaneously.

It's worth noting that other implementations of Python, such as Jython or IronPython, do not use the GIL, and some alternative implementations of CPython, such as PyPy, have a different approach to handling concurrency that can mitigate the performance impact of the GIL.

Python's Global Interpreter Lock, or GIL, is a mechanism used in the CPython implementation of Python that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. This means that even in a multi-threaded environment, only one thread can execute Python code at any given time, while other threads have to wait for the lock to be released. The GIL is used to ensure thread-safety and prevent conflicts when accessing Python objects, as well as to simplify the implementation of the interpreter. However, this can also limit the performance of multi-threaded applications, particularly those that rely heavily on CPU-bound tasks. [1][2][3]

The GIL is a solution to the common problem of dealing with shared resources, like memory in a computer. When two threads try to modify the same resource at the same time, they can step on each otherâ€™s toes.
